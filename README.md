Higher level, asynchronous, pure Rust [AT-SPI2](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Accessibility/AT-SPI2/) protocol implementation using
[zbus](https://crates.io/crates/zbus).

Part of the [Odilia screen reader project](https://odilia.app).

## Design

* Fully documented, with `#[deny(missing_docs)]`
* Or at least, it will be by 1.0
* Fully safe, with `#[deny(unsafe_code)]`
* Fantastic code style with `#[deny(clippy:all, clippy::pedantic, clippy::cargo)]`

This crate makes use of the
[zbus crate](https://crates.io/crates/zbus) for
[dbus communication](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus/).
We use the asynchronous zbus API, so to use atspi, you will need to run an async executer like
[tokio](https://crates.io/crates/tokio) or
[smol](https://crates.io/crates/smol).

## Feature Flags

- `default`: `proxies`, `connection`.
- `proxies`: enable re-export of the `atspi-proxies` crate; this allows you to directly communicate with DBus.
- `connection`: enable re-export of the `atspi-connection` crate; this gives some nice abstractions over DBus when receiving only. `proxies` will still be needed to query information actively.
- `tokio`: enable support for the `tokio` runtime; other runtimes can be used without an integration feature.
    - One exception on `glomio` as it has its own types not related to how other runtimes work; `atspi` is **_not_** compatible with `atspi` (PRs welcome though)
- `tracing`: enable support for the `tracing` logger.

## D-Bus type validation

Atspi is used to send and receive data to and from applications. Sender and recipient need to agree on the shape of the data type for fruitful communication. Our best bet is to keep our types in sync with the protocol descriptions.

We employ [zbus-lockstep](https://github.com/luukvanderduim/zbus-lockstep/) to match types against those defined in the AT-SPI2 protocol descriptions.

Not all types can be validated (easily) with zbus_lockstep because types may not exist
in the protocol descriptions, for example because they are deprecated (but still in use) or we have chosen a different representation.
