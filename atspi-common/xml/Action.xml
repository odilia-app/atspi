      org.a11y.atspi.Action:
      @short_description: Allows exploring and invoking the actions of a user-actionable UI component.

      For example, a button may expose a "click" action; a popup menu may expose an "open"
      action.  Components which are not "passive" providers of UI information should
      implement this interface, unless there is a more specialized interface for
      interaction like org.a11y.atspi.Text or org.a11y.atspi.Value.

        example, a screen reader will read out this description when the user asks for
        extra detail on an action.  For example, "Clicks the button" for the "click"

        Returns: A short, localized name for the action at the specified @index.  This is
        what screen readers will read out during normal navigation.  For example, "Click"
        for a button.

    <!--
        GetKeyBinding:
        @index: 0-based index of the action to query.

        Gets the keybinding which can be used to activate this action, if one
        exists. The string returned should contain localized, human-readable,
        key sequences as they would appear when displayed on screen. It must
        be in the format "mnemonic;sequence;shortcut".

        - The mnemonic key activates the object if it is presently enabled onscreen.
          This typically corresponds to the underlined letter within the widget.
          Example: "n" in a traditional "New..." menu item or the "a" in "Apply" for
          a button.

        - The sequence is the full list of keys which invoke the action even if the
          relevant element is not currently shown on screen. For instance, for a menu
          item the sequence is the keybindings used to open the parent menus before
          invoking. The sequence string is colon-delimited. Example: "Alt+F:N" in a
          traditional "New..." menu item.

        - The shortcut, if it exists, will invoke the same action without showing
          the component or its enclosing menus or dialogs. Example: "Ctrl+N" in a
          traditional "New..." menu item.

        Example: For a traditional "New..." menu item, the expected return value
        would be: "N;Alt+F:N;Ctrl+N" for the English locale and "N;Alt+D:N;Strg+N"
        for the German locale. If, hypothetically, this menu item lacked a mnemonic,
        it would be represented by ";;Ctrl+N" and ";;Strg+N" respectively.

        If there is no key binding for this action, return "".

        actions that an object supports.  See the GetKeyBinding method for a description
        of that field's syntax.

        This is equivalent to using the methods GetLocalizedName, GetDescription,
        GetKeyBinding for each action, but with a single call and thus less DBus traffic.

        By convention, if there is more than one action available, the first one is
        considered the "default" action of the object.
