        using versioned interface names instead.  Just return "2.1" here.

        Id: set to an arbitrary numerical id when an application registers with the registry.

        When a freshly-started application uses the
        org.a11y.atspi.Socket.Embed method to register with the
        accessibility registry, the registry will set a numerical id
        on the application.

        Per https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/at-spi2-core/-/issues/82 it
        may turn out that this id is not actually used subsequently.
        This is a remnant of the time when registryd actually had to
        make up identifiers for each application.  With DBus, however,
        it is the bus that assigns unique names to applications that
        connect to it.

        Your application or toolkit can remember the Id passed when
        the accessibility registry sets this property, and return it
        back when the property is read.
