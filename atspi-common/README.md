# `atspi-common`

Common data structures for the `atspi` crate.
This crate is meant to only contain the absolute lowest common denominator for libraries to talk to each other about `atspi` information;
therefore, it attempts to be able to compile on basically any architecture (including WASM).

Please use the internal documentation to learn how to use these data structures.
