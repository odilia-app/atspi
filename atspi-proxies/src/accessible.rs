	/// These relationships allow for better identification of how objects are associated with one another.
	///
	/// For example, the relationship [`RelationType::LabelledBy`] can be used to identify labeling information
	/// that should accompany the accessible [`name`] property when presenting an object's content or identity
	/// to the end user.
	///
	/// Similarly, [`RelationType::ControllerFor`] can be used to specify the context in which a valuator is useful
	/// and/or the other UI components that are directly affected by user interactions with the valuator.
	/// Common examples include the association of scrollbars with the viewport or panel that they control.
	///
	/// [`RelationType`]: crate::common::RelationType

	///
	/// Roles make it possible for various UI toolkits to expose their controls to
	/// assistive technologies (ATs) with a standard interface, regardless of toolkit.
	///
	/// For example, a widget that acts like a conventional push button
	/// (appears unpressed; presses	when acted upon; invokes a certain action
	/// when pressed) can expose an	[`Role::PushButton`] role.

	/// This is a longer description than the [`Name`][name] property.
	///
	/// For example, a button might have a name of "OK", but a description of "OK button".
	///
	/// While the Name property is meant to be a short string that screen readers say
	/// during normal navigation, the Description property is for when the user asks for

	/// For example, "en_US.UTF-8" or "de_DE.UTF-8".
	///
	/// For an application, this may be the locale for the language that the application
	/// shows in its user interface.
	///
	/// For a document being shown in an application, or a paragraph within a document,
	/// the locale may refer to that object exclusively. For example:
	/// an application may be showing itself in English ("en"), but it may be used to
	/// display a document in Spanish ("es").
	/// In the latter case, a screen reader will want to know that it should switch to
	/// Spanish while reading the document.

	/// Human-readable, localized, short name for the object.

	///
	/// Consider a widget to select RGB colors by setting three sliders.
	/// The	names for the sliders would be "Red", "Green", "Blue", respectively, or
	/// their translations to application's locale.  The names would be unnecessary if each
	/// slider had a `LabeledBy` relation to corresponding labels visible in the user

	/// for the object path.
	///
	/// Root object:
	/// An application must have a single root object, called "/org/a11y/atspi/accessible/root".
	/// All other objects should have that one as their highest-level ancestor.
