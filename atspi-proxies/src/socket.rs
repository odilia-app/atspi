	///
	/// This is the entry point for an application that wants to register itself against
	/// the accessibility registry.  The application's root object, which it passes in
	/// @plug, must support the org.a11y.atspi.Application interface.
	///
	/// When an application calls this method on the registry, the following handshake happens:
	///
	/// * Application calls this method on the registry to identify itself.
	/// * The registry sets the "Id" property on the org.a11y.atspi.Application interface on the @plug object.
	/// * The Embed method returns with the bus name and object path for the registry's root object.
	/// Returns: the bus name and object path of the registry's root object.
	fn embed(&self, plug: &(&str, zbus::zvariant::ObjectPath<'_>)) -> zbus::Result<ObjectRef>;

	/// This method is called by a socket to inform the plug that it is being
	/// embedded. The plug should register the embedding socket as its parent.

	/// Unembed method
	/// @plug: a string for the unique bus name of the application, and an object path
	/// for the application's' root object.
	///
	/// Unregisters an application from the accesibility registry.  It is not necessary to
	/// call this method; the accessibility registry detects when an application
	/// disconnects from the bus.
