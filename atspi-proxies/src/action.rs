trait Action {

	/// Returns an array of (localized-) name, (localized-)
	/// description, keybinding) for the actions that an object
	/// supports.
	///
	/// See [`get_keybinding`] method for a description of that
	/// field's syntax.
	///
	/// This is equivalent to using the methods [`get_localized_name`],
	/// [`get_description`] and	[`get_keybinding`] for each action,
	/// but with a single call and thus less DBus traffic.
	///
	///	By convention, if there is more than one action available,
	/// the first one is considered the "default" action of the object.
	fn get_actions(&self) -> zbus::Result<Vec<(String, String, String)>>;

	/// Returns the localized description for the action at the specified
	/// index, starting at zero.
	///   
	/// For	example, a screen reader will read out this description when
	/// the user asks for extra detail on an action.
	/// For example, "Clicks the button" for the "click" action of a button.
	fn get_description(&self, index: i32) -> zbus::Result<String>;

	/// Returns the keybinding for the action, specified by a 
	/// zero-based index.
	/// 
	/// Gets the keybinding which can be used to invoke this action,
	/// if one exists.
	/// 
	/// The string returned should contain localized, human-readable,
	/// key sequences as they would appear when displayed on screen.
	/// It must be in the format "mnemonic;sequence;shortcut".
	/// 
	/// - The mnemonic key activates the object if it is presently 
	/// enabled on screen.
	/// This typically corresponds to the underlined letter within 
	/// the widget. Example: "n" in a traditional "Ṉew..." menu 
	/// item or the "a" in "Apply" for a button.
	/// 
	/// - The sequence is the full list of keys which invoke the action 
	/// even if the relevant element is not currently shown on screen. 
	/// For instance, for a menu item the sequence is the keybindings 
	/// used to open the parent menus before invoking.
	/// 
	/// The sequence string is colon-delimited. Example: "Alt+F:N" in a
	/// traditional "Ṉew..." menu item.
	///
	/// - The shortcut, if it exists, will invoke the same action without
	/// showing the component or its enclosing menus or dialogs.
	/// Example: "Ctrl+N" in a traditional "Ṉew..." menu item.
	/// The shortcut string is colon-delimited. Example: "Ctrl+N" in a
	/// traditional "Ṉew..." menu item.
	/// 
	/// Example: For a traditional "Ṉew..." menu item, the expected return 
	/// value would be: "N;Alt+F:N;Ctrl+N" for the English locale and 
	/// "N;Alt+D:N;Strg+N" for the German locale. 
	/// If, hypothetically, this menu item lacked a mnemonic, it would be 
	/// represented by ";;Ctrl+N" and ";;Strg+N" respectively.
	/// 
	/// If there is no key binding for this action, "" is returned.
	fn get_key_binding(&self, index: i32) -> zbus::Result<String>;

	/// Returns a short, localized name for the action at the specified by a
	/// zero-based index.
	///
	/// This is	what screen readers will read out during normal navigation.
	/// For example, "Click" for a button.
	fn get_localized_name(&self, index: i32) -> zbus::Result<String>;

	/// Returns a machine-readable name for the action at the specified,
	/// zero-based index.
	fn get_name(&self, index: i32) -> zbus::Result<String>;

	/// Returns the number of available actions.
